# PacManFactory
A cute little tool that creates a number of PacMen upon pressing a button.
Click the "Create" button to make a new PacMan.
Click the "Start Game" button to make the PacMen move.
Some future changes: As you can see, there are four images for this exercise. In the future, I'd like to make each PacMan animated and maybe even add some little white dots for him to eat :)
